## Discrete Adventure

A text adventure game where you make choices from a limited set of options. The options and the next portion of the story are generated by the LLM.

### Extension: NPC Agents

There are multiple agents out there that interact with you in a structured way.

### Extension: Mutable World

The LLM comes up with ways to modify the world based on what you do.

## Natural Robot

The model must translate some natural language instructions into a sequence of structured instructions to give the robot (in structured output mode). Then the user has to instruct the robot to do certain tasks. The kinds of things the robot can do:
- move around
- interact at a position
  - pick up an item
  - drop an item

## Manager Sim

The user is in charge of a collection of agents, And is trying to get them to work together to achieve a task. Each agent Is powered by a model, And they are trying to do a specific task, And you interact with them in real time, Queue up messages for them to take your account next.

The main thing to figure out is what kind of tasks you want them to be working on, and how those results can be entered together to be something that you can kind of monitor from a high level. Perhaps something like writing could serve this purpose -- They are trying to write a story or something. 

It doesn't actually have to be in real time, but that would make it more game-like.
