Stats
- these stats serve as quantitative ways for the LLM to keep in mind when suggesting things for you to do
- what you choose during the course of gameplay will modify your stats, which will in turn give you other options down the line of course
- the stats are:
  - charm
  - empathy
  - creativity
  - intelligence
  - wisdom

Phases
1. Swipe through a few accounts, to decide on which to pursue 
  - generatively decide on which match with you, so its possible to fail to match?
2. Secretly build arc for date
  - there are a few pre-defined arcs
  - the arc will insert a few different transitions throughout the cource of the date
  - these arcs can be generated by LLM of course but probably want to do some curation
3. Date actions
  - for every thing that happens, will randomly choose a few different actions you can take based on what will affect your stats
